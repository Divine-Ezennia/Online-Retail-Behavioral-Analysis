# 📘 Executive Behavioral Intelligence Report

This directory contains the formal **Executive-Level Strategic Report** for the *Online Retail Behavioral Analysis* project.

While the `scripts/` directory documents the full analytical architecture and the `visualizations/` folder houses all R-generated and Tableau-enhanced visuals, this folder delivers the **boardroom-ready synthesis** of those findings.
