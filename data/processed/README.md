# 📦 Processed Data Layer

This directory contains all intermediate and final analytical artifacts generated by the modular R pipeline located in `/scripts`.  

These files are **derived outputs**, not source data.

They are programmatically generated using `saveRDS()` and consumed downstream via `readRDS()` across scripts 02 → 11.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Role

The `processed/` directory represents the **transformation layer** within the project’s analytical architecture.

It stores:

- Cleaned datasets
- Enriched datasets
- Aggregated metrics
- Cross-dimensional intelligence outputs
- Segment intelligence artifacts

These artifacts function as **state checkpoints**, allowing:

- Modular execution
- Reproducibility
- Object traceability
- Efficient downstream visualization rendering

## 🔄 Data Flow Dependency

The processing hierarchy follows strict sequential execution:

```
01_data_loading.R
        ↓
02_data_cleaning.R
        ↓
03_data_enrichment.R
        ↓
04_foundational_metrics.R
        ↓
05_product_performance_analysis.R
        ↓
06_temporal_behavior_analysis.R
        ↓
07_geographic_country_analysis.R
        ↓
08_cross_dimensional_analysis.R
        ↓
09_rfm_segmentation_engine.R
        ↓
10_segment_intelligence_engine.R
        ↓
11_visualization_engine.R
```

Each script produces `.rds` artifacts consumed by subsequent stages.

## 📂 Artifact Categories

Artifacts are grouped logically by analytical domain:

### 1️⃣ Enriched Core Dataset
- `online_retail_enriched.rds`

### 2️⃣ Foundational Metrics
- Unique products and order-based aggregations

### 3️⃣ Product Intelligence
- Top/bottom products by:
  - Total Quantity
  - Average Quantity
  - Total Revenue
  - Average Revenue
  - Order Frequency

### 4️⃣ Temporal Intelligence
- Hourly
- Daily
- WeekPart
- Monthly

Each dimension includes:
- Total metrics
- Average metrics
- Order-line metrics
- Distinct order metrics (where applicable)

### 5️⃣ Geographic Intelligence
- Country-level quantity, revenue, and order metrics

### 6️⃣ Cross-Dimensional Intelligence
- Product × Temporal
- Product × Country

### 7️⃣ RFM & Segment Intelligence
- RFM scored customers
- Segment-level distributions
- Segment × Product intelligence
- Segment × Geographic intelligence
- CLV evaluation
- Churn assessment
- Average Order Value

## ⚠️ Version Control Policy

This directory is excluded from Git tracking via:

```
data/processed/*.rds
```

### Rationale

- `.rds` files are deterministic outputs
- They can be regenerated by executing scripts in order
- Prevents repository bloat
- Maintains clean commit history
- Enforces pipeline reproducibility

---

## 🔁 Reproducibility Protocol

To regenerate this directory:

1. Clone repository
2. Ensure required R packages are installed
3. Execute scripts sequentially from `01` to `11`
4. `.rds` artifacts will automatically populate `data/processed/`

No manual file manipulation is required.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

This directory operationalizes the project as a **true analytical engine** rather than a static notebook.

It enables:

- Deterministic rebuilding of insights
- Modular debugging
- Scalable extension
- Professional production discipline

This structure mirrors enterprise-grade analytics pipelines.
