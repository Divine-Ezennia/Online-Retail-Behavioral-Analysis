# 📂 Data Architecture & Governance

This directory defines the complete data lifecycle for the **Online Retail Intelligence System**.

It separates raw source data from transformed analytical artifacts, enforcing clear boundaries between:

- Immutable source records
- Engineered transformation outputs
- Reproducible intelligence layers

This design follows a production-grade data engineering model.

# 1️⃣ RAW DATA LAYER (`/raw`)

## Purpose
Stores the original dataset exactly as obtained from its source.

This layer remains:
- Immutable
- Unaltered
- Audit-traceable

## Source Provenance

- **Dataset:** UCI Online Retail Dataset  
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Nature:** Public transactional e-commerce dataset  
- **Volume:** 541,000+ records  

The raw file is intentionally excluded from version control due to size.

## Governance Policy

- No transformation occurs in this layer.
- No derived files are stored here.
- The dataset can be re-downloaded from the official UCI repository.

See: [README.md](./raw/README.md) for full documentation.

---

# 2️⃣ PROCESSED DATA LAYER (`/processed`)

## Purpose

Contains all transformation artifacts generated by the modular R pipeline 
located in `/scripts`.

These files:

- Are generated using `saveRDS()`
- Are consumed via `readRDS()`
- Represent intermediate and final analytical states
- Are fully reproducible

## Characteristics

- Deterministic outputs
- Regenerable from raw data
- Structured as modular checkpoints
- Excluded from Git tracking

See: [README.md](./processed/README.md) for complete artifact classification.

# 🔄 Data Lifecycle Flow

```
UCI Online Retail Dataset (raw CSV)
            ↓
01_data_loading.R
            ↓
02_data_cleaning.R
            ↓
03_data_enrichment.R
            ↓
04 → 10 Analytical Intelligence Modules
            ↓
11_visualization_engine.R
            ↓

This flow enforces:

- Separation of concerns
- Controlled state transitions
- Reproducibility
- Audit transparency

# 📊 Data Engineering Philosophy

This repository does **not** treat data as a static analysis input.

Instead, it enforces:

- Layered transformation logic
- Script-based state generation
- Modular checkpoint artifacts
- Deterministic rebuilding capability

The `.rds` architecture ensures that:

- Each script can run independently after its dependency is satisfied
- Debugging is isolated to transformation stage
- Visualization consumes stable analytical outputs

---

# 🔐 Version Control Policy

The following are excluded from Git tracking:

```
.Rhistory
.RData
.Ruserdata
.Rproj.user/
data/processed/*.rds
```

### Rationale

- Large file sizes
- Deterministic regeneration
- Prevent repository bloat
- Maintain clean commit history
- Enforce engineering discipline

The repository tracks:

- Transformation logic
- Feature engineering
- Intelligence computation
- Visualization generation
- Documentation

Not data artifacts.

---

# ♻️ Reproducibility Protocol

To fully rebuild the data layer:

1. Clone repository
2. Download UCI Online Retail dataset into `/data/raw/`
3. Install required R packages
4. Execute scripts sequentially from `01` through `11`
5. `.rds` artifacts will populate `/data/processed/`
6. Visualization outputs will populate `/visualizations/`

No manual data editing is required.

# 🧠 Why This Architecture Matters

This structure elevates the project from:

> A reporting notebook

to

> A deterministic analytical intelligence engine

It enables:

- Professional reproducibility
- Modular extensibility
- Auditability
- Scalability
- Enterprise-grade clarity

The data folder is not storage.
It is infrastructure.
