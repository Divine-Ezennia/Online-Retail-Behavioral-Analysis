# 📊 Visual Intelligence Layer

This directory contains all visual outputs generated for the **Online Retail Behavioral Analysis** project.

The visualization architecture is deliberately modular and mirrors the analytical pipeline established in `scripts/`. Every visual artifact is reproducible, traceable to a processed `.rds` object, and categorized according to analytical domain.

The objective of this folder is to separate:

- Analytical computation (scripts/)
- Processed intelligence artifacts (data/processed/)
- Visual communication layer (visualizations/)

This ensures structural clarity, reproducibility, and production-grade governance.

# I. R-Generated Visual Outputs

All visuals within the following folders are programmatically generated by:

`11_visualization_engine.R`

These outputs are fully reproducible via `ggsave()` and derived strictly from processed `.rds` files.

---

## [1️⃣ Product Intelligence](./product/)

Focus: Merchandise performance and demand dominance.

Includes:
- Top bulk-purchased products (total & average)
- Top revenue-generating products (total & average)
- Top order-frequency products

Purpose:
Establishes merchandise-level performance concentration and identifies unit, revenue, and demand leaders.

---

## [2️⃣ Temporal Intelligence](./temporal/)

Focus: Time-structured purchasing behavior.

Includes:
- Hour-level demand patterns
- Day-of-week revenue and quantity behavior
- WeekPart (Weekday vs Weekend) distribution analysis
- Monthly seasonality analysis
- Order and order-line throughput dynamics

Purpose:
Reveals cyclical purchasing rhythms, operational demand pressure windows, and seasonal revenue depth.

---

## [3️⃣ Geographic Intelligence](./geographic/)

Focus: Country-level dominance and spatial behavior.

Includes:
- Top countries by total & average quantity
- Top countries by total & average revenue
- Order frequency (bar + spatial map)
- Order line intensity (bar + spatial map)

Purpose:
Identifies high-performing markets and spatial concentration of commercial activity.

---

## [4️⃣ Cross-Dimensional Intelligence](./cross/)

Focus: Product × Time × Geography intersections.

Includes:
- Top 2 products by hour, day, weekpart, month
- Revenue depth across temporal partitions
- Order-line processing intensity
- Country-product dominance relationships

Purpose:
Moves beyond single-axis analysis to uncover layered behavioral patterns and operational strain points.

---

## [5️⃣ Segment Intelligence](./segment/)

Focus: RFM-driven behavioral segmentation insights.

Includes:
- Segment distribution (customer weight)
- Segment revenue dominance (total & average)
- Segment order concentration
- Segment × product preference heterogeneity
- Segment × country dominance
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- Churn rate assessment
- Average Order Value (AOV)

Purpose:
Transforms raw transactional data into behavioral intelligence, enabling strategic targeting and value optimization.

---

# II. Tableau Intelligence Layer (`/tableau/`)

The Tableau layer exists to communicate complex statistical relationships with greater intuitive clarity.

## [A. Static Exports](./tableau/static_exports/)

These PNG files correspond to advanced analytical insights documented in the report:

- Segment-Based Hourly Purchase Intensity
- Segment-Based Hourly Order Intensity
- Segment-Based Monthly Revenue Depth
- Price-Demand Elasticity Relationships
- Recency-Monetary Behavioral Relationships
- Frequency-Monetary Behavioral Relationships

These visuals enhance interpretability of multi-variable statistical relationships.

---

## [B. Interactive Dashboard](./tableau/dashboard/)

This directory contains documentation for the full interactive Tableau dashboard.

Dashboard Objectives:

- Executive summary view of performance
- Segment-level behavioral drilldown
- Product intelligence interaction
- Geographic revenue filtering
- Temporal demand exploration

---

# 🔁 Reproducibility Standard

All R-generated visuals are:

- Derived from version-controlled `.rds` files
- Reproducible via `11_visualization_engine.R`
- Saved using deterministic naming convention (`fig_11_xx_...`)
- Categorized by analytical layer

This ensures:

- Analytical integrity
- Transparent lineage from raw data → processed intelligence → visual communication
- Production-grade deployment discipline

---

# 📌 Architectural Philosophy

This visualization layer is not merely aesthetic.

It functions as:

- A communication interface for analytical intelligence
- A validation mechanism for statistical outputs
- A strategic decision-support surface

Every visual artifact is directly traceable to upstream computation steps, reinforcing structural coherence across the entire repository.
